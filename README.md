# About this project: 

This project is a platform for writers to post their work, whether they are poets, novelist or short story writers who need feedback from readers and recognition from publishers. 
In this project I used React as front-end and Express as back-end. In this project I have 2 tables, one for users and the othe is for stories/posts 

## Technologies used: 

- React 
- Express

### Future enhancements:

1. Add comment section for the readers to leave their feedback, which will be its own table. 
1. Add a publisher timeline and enable them to post their offers or needs and let the writers contact them.
1. Add likes to the post , and read later section.
